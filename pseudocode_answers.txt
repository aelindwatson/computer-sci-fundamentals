Short Answer
  
  1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Pseudocode feels like the initial sketch or outline of the logic needed to implement whatever is        being asked of the developer.  This is the initial brainstorm of the work, and once it’s complete you fill in the code.

    2.  If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

If you tried to run pseudocode on your computer it wouldn’t do anything, maybe throw error messages.  Pseudocode is meant for humans to read not computers.


Programming Assignment


     1.  Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than the second number
     PRINT first number
ELSE
     PRINT second number
END IF

     2.  Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

SET number that equals one
      PRINT number
REPEAT 	
     INCREMENT number by one
     PRINT result
UNTIL 
     number equals one hundred

     3.  Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INIT a phonebook list
INPUT a name entry search
FOR each idea in the phonebook list 
  IF name entry search equals an index in the phonebook list
  CALL  name entry search RETURNING name entry search phonebook list
ENDWHILE

    4.  Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var array = [list of names and phone numbers]

function findPhoneNumber(name){
    var nameSearch = [ ];
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++}{
       if (name === array[i]){
       nameSearch.push(array[i]);
    }
  }
  return nameSearch;
}
